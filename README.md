# zipkin implementation
Proof of concept for Zipkin using Elasticsearch as the storage, the stack is setup / orchestrated using docker swarm. 
Also used are tools such as cadvisor for monitoring & visualizer for getting a visual representation of the stack. 


# Docker 1.13
This implementation uses the Docker Stack command for spinning up the entire stack in one go. And would need docker engine V-1.13 for running.
